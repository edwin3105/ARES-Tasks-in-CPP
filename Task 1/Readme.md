## Scaling
Resized window to width=(image_width * 0.6) and height=(image_height * 0.6).

## Translation
Translated image to coordinates=(100,50) w.r.t origin.

## Rotation
Rotated the image around center=(image_width/2, image_height/2) and by 60 degrees.

## Perspective Transformation
Coordinates of the roi (Region of Image), whose perspective has to be transformed is taken from persptrack.cpp. These coordinates are then taken and transformed in perspective.cpp accordingly.
