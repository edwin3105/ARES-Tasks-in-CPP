## Sharpening
In this a kernel of 3x3 is used for the purpose to implement filter2D function

## Smoothening
In this, all four types of blurs have been demonstrated having kernel size 5x5. 

In gaussian blur, standard deviation is kept 0 so that it could adapt accordingly to kernel.

In bilateral filter, aperture size is kept 10, and sigma color and sigma space, both is kept 110.
